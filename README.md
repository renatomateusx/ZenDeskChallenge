# ZenDesk Challenge
Project made to always remember me the structure about the clean arch and how are the communication between modules and projects.

The CleanArch have with on of the others promess, protect each module's product, make separeted each implementation and communication each other.
This project was build on java.


# Testing

If someone needs to test, please, be sure all dependencies already loaded.
Then, you can post on v1/ticket/openTicket (to open a ticket), v1/ticket/listTickets to retrieve all saved ticket.

I know, the API is simple but, when i need to learn or remember anything, i come here or i do create a new implementation here.

Fell your self in home.
